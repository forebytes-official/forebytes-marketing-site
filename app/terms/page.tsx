              <p>Forebytes is a free restaurant discovery app. There are no payments, paid tiers, or in-app purchases today.</p>
              <p>Restaurant listings come from Mapbox&apos;s map data. Menus, dish photos, prices, descriptions, and allergen information are contributed by users, not verified by Forebytes or supplied by the restaurants themselves. Real size models are measured with a LiDAR scan but can still differ from what you&apos;re served. Approximate models are estimates.</p>
              <p className="callout"><b>Important:</b> do not rely on allergen or dietary information shown in the app as a substitute for asking the restaurant directly, especially where a genuine allergy or medical condition is involved. This information is user-submitted and may be incomplete, outdated, or wrong.</p>

Our total liability for any claim arising from your use of the app will not exceed the amount you paid us in the twelve months before the claim (which, as the app is currently free, is zero).</p>
